Bubble Sort worst case O(n2)
insertion Sort worst case O(n2)
selection Sort worst case O(n2)
merge sort worst case O(nlogn)
In the worst case, merge sort does about 39% fewer comparisons than 
quicksort does in the average case. In terms of moves, merge sort's worst
case complexity is O(n log n)â€”the same complexity as quicksort's best case,
and merge sort's best case takes about half as many iterations as the worst case.


quick sort worst case o(n2)
aver and best is o(nlogn)

counting sort  worst case is o(k+n)


Radix sort complexity is O(wn) for n keys which are integers of word size w. 
Sometimes w is presented as a constant, which would make radix sort better 
(for sufficiently large n) than the best comparison-based sorting algorithms, 
which all perform O(n log n) comparisons to sort n keys.
