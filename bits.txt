fastest way to find bits set in n 
n & n-1 till n > 0 and count iterations happened

even numbers n & 1 = 0
odd numbers n & 1 = 1

no of even numbers by rotation depends on number of zero's just count the zero's


individual bit addition a^b
carry a&b

for integers

if xor all elements in array you get the unique elem

for anagram ++ and -- elements and find result
